How to run HashServer

To run this application, open the cmd prompt and execute command 
go run HashService.go

Alternatively you can add a server:port as parameter and execute command as

go run HashService.go :8080 

or 

go run HashService.go localhost:8080

By default, the application will use localhost:8080 if no value is supplied.

This was a fun experience and thank you for the opportunity.
